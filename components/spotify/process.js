					</Text>

						With a variety of ideas, I scoped down by conducting an

						activities, and a featured podcast section with curated

					<Header>REFLECTION</Header>
					<Text>
						This was a really exciting and fun project for me to
						work on because I had to dive into an unknown product,
						design system, and problem space. I learned so much in
						this project and here are some of my key takeaways.
					</Text>
					<Subheader>Iterate, iterate, iterate</Subheader>
					<Text>
						Itâ€™s important to continue thinking outside and inside
						the box at every step of the design process. Being
						open-minded helped me go through many ideas and find the
						best solution at each step.
					</Text>
					<Subheader>
						Think big picture, but design little pixels
					</Subheader>
					<Text>
						Something I focused on for this project was working
						within constraints. I made sure to choose the most
						feasible, impactful solution to the problem instead of
						designing a brand new, sky-high experience like many of
						my course projects.
					</Text>
					<Subheader>Feedback is always valuable</Subheader>
					<Text>
						Within the 8 weeks, it was difficult to conduct a lot of
						formal usability and a/b testing. But, being able to
						reach out and just ask for small feedback helped me
						throughout the process immensely.
					</Text>
					<br />

						Thanks to the{' '}
						<A href='https://applied2020.com/' target='_blank'>

						</A>{' '}
						for providing a fun mock-internship experience! I
						appreciate my buddies, mentors, and fellow designers for
